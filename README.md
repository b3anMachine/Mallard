# Mallard!
Mallard! is an arcade-style video game that plays like Wozniak's Breakout. I built this to gain practice in game design, OOD design patterns, and Java. I plan to update this readme and go into detail on those concepts I explored. In the meanwhile, feel free to look around. If you're on a Mac, you can grab the initial release.
