# Mallard!
Mallard! is an arcade-style video game that plays like Wozniak's Breakout. I built this to gain practice in game design, OOD design patterns, and Java. I plan to update this readme and go into detail on those concepts I explored. In the meanwhile, feel free to look around. 

If you're on a Mac, you can grab the initial release. Due to Apple’s latest security measures, you will have to set your *Allow apps downloaded from* option to *Anywhere* in System Preferences. If you are on Sierra or above, this option is hidden. You will have to run the following command in Terminal to unhide the option:
```
sudo spctl --master-disable
```
Otherwise, Mac OS may warn you—rather dramitically—that the app is “Damaged and can’t be opened.”

You can re-hide the option with this command:
```
sudo spctl --master-enable
```
